Arduino
========

* Arduino is an open-source tool used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a micro-controller) and a development environment, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the board

* For more information, please consult the website at: http://www.arduino.org/

A special thanks to  Daniela Antonietti, Hernando Barrag√°n, David Cuartielles, Ben Fry, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, David A. Mellis, Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas for their works and inspirations.

Arduino uses the [GNU avr-gcc toolchain](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc), [avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/), [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/), and code from
[Processing](http://www.processing.org) and [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co).
